#TASK: run the code below to get and save the dataset
download.file(url = "https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-api/international/2022/wc_matches.csv", destfile = "WorldCup.csv")
#Then you need to name your dataset. Run this:
WorldCup<- read.csv("WorldCup.csv")

download.file(url = "https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-api/international/2022/wc_matches.csv", destfile = "WorldCup.csv")
WorldCup<- read.csv("WorldCup.csv")

#TASK: take a look at the World Cup data. 

#TASK: Install and call the dplyr package. 
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

#Let's make a random sample of our data and save it
#Task: run the code below
mysample<-sample_n(WorldCup, size=15, replace = FALSE, weight = NULL, .env = NULL)
mysample<-sample_n(WorldCup, size=15, replace = FALSE, weight = NULL, .env = NULL)

#TASK: Save the new sample as a csv file
write.csv(mysample, file = "mysample.csv")


#Now let's have some fun with *piping*

#we will use our mysample dataset
#The pipe, %>%, comes from the magrittr package. 
#Packages in the tidyverse (like dplyr) load %>% for you automatically, 
#so you donâ€™t usually load magrittr explicitly.

#Example: Let's try some piping with our mysample data. Note how the dataset name is not repeated in each function
piping<-mysample %>% 
  rename(SoccerPowerIndex = spi1) %>%
  subset(SoccerPowerIndex >60) %>%
  dim()%>%
  print()

#TASK: revise this code chunk using piping
mysample2<-mysample
arrange(mysample2, date)
mysample2<-filter(mysample2, spi1<80)
mysample2<-rename(mysample2, Index1 = spi1, Index2 = spi2)
mysample3<-select(mysample2, Index1, Index2, team1, team2 )
mysample4<-summary(mysample3)
print(mysample4)

mysample2<-mysample%>%
  arrange(date) %>%
  filter(spi1 < 80) %>%
  rename(Index1 = spi1, Index2 = spi2) %>%
  select(Index1, Index2, team1, team2) %>%
  summary() %>%
  print()
mysample2
